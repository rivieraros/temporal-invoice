Extraction rules:
- Every row in the statement should become one transaction entry.
- Carry forward the current Subnote as lot_number for subsequent rows until the Subnote changes.
- For each "Feed inv:Lot" row, add a lot_references entry.
- For each lot, capture the "Ending Balance" amount when present.
- The "OCTOBER FEED BILL" line is usually a credit that offsets prior balance; keep it as-is.

CRITICAL - Amount accuracy:
- Read each digit in dollar amounts very carefully.
- For statement_charge amounts, double-check each digit. Common errors: 9 vs 5, 1 vs 7, 8 vs 6.
- Cross-reference: The statement_charge for each lot should match the line item in the transactions.
- The total_balance should approximately equal the sum of all lot ending balances.
- Count all lots carefully - ensure you capture EVERY lot listed, even if some are on different pages.
