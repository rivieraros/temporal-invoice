Extraction rules:
- Keep all line items exactly as shown (Feed & Rations, Hospital Feed, Medicine, TCFA Dues, Cattle Insurance, etc.).
- Parse rate and quantity from the line item row when shown; keep units in rate_unit and quantity_unit.
- If a value is present but unit is missing, set the unit to null.
- Map PTD and Lifetime values into performance_metrics list. Use metric_name exactly as the label on the invoice.
- Feeding Expense rows should include FEED, MEDICINE, PROCESSING, CATTLE DUES/INS, Total Feeding Expenses, Total All Cost, Owner Charges to Date, Total Amount when present.
- If a section does not exist on the invoice, return an empty list for that section.

CRITICAL - Amount accuracy:
- Read each digit in the Total column very carefully. Common OCR errors: 9↔5, 1↔7, 8↔6, 3↔8.
- The total_amount_due MUST equal the sum of all line_items[].total values.
- If you notice the sum doesn't match, re-read the individual line item totals.
- For Feed & Rations: verify by checking rate × quantity ÷ 2000 (to convert lbs to tons) ≈ total.
- Capture ALL line items - do not skip any rows in the charges table.
